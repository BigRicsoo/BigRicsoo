## Hello Github

My name is Rich√°rd Nagy, I'm a Web developer or would like to be one. I finished studying information technologies in the summer of 2021, and ever since then I have been constantly learning and developing my skills.

I'm mainly interested in Frontend development, primarily using ReactJs, but I'm also open to learning backend.

Technologies that I have experience with:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Typescript
- ReactJs
- NodeJs
- Redux
- Bootstrap
- MaterialUI
- MySQL
