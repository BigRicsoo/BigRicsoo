## Hello Github

My name is Rich√°rd Nagy, I'm a self-taught Web developer or at least I would like to be one. I finished studying information technologies at summer 2021, and ever since then I am constantly learning and developing my skills.

I mainly use Javascript, React, CSS and NodeJS, but here are all my the languages and technologies I have experience with:
- Javascript
- CSS
- React
- NodeJS
- Express
- MySQL
- Redux
- Firebase

**I have 0 experience but I'll learn whatever you want me to learn!**
